   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Installation
============

T3f assumes you have Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, or 3.6 and a working TensorFlow installation, tested versions are from 1.0 to 1.11 (see here_ for TF installation instructions).

.. _here: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/

We don't include it into pip requirements since the installation of TensorFlow varies depending on your setup.

Then simply run

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install t3f
