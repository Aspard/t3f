   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Installation
============

T3f assumes you have Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, or 3.6 and a working TensorFlow installation, supported versions are from 1.0 to 1.7 (see [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.7/install/) for TF 1.7 installation instructions).

We don't include it into pip requirements since the installation of TensorFlow varies depending on your setup.

Then simply run

```bash
pip install t3f
```
