# This file is needed since we do not include tensorflow into pip requirements
# in the main module (since tf comes in many different forms and it's hard
# to check if one of them is installed), but tf is necessary for building
# the docs with readthedocs.org: they fetch a fresh version of the
# library on each build and it doesn't import properly without tensorflow
# being installed.
